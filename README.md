# Microseismic Detection on Distributed Acoustic Sensing Arrays using Deep Learning from the Utah FORGE Well 16A (78)-32 Hydraulic Stimulation 
 DASEventNet model for detect microseismic from DAS Fiber based on the ResNet network. 

 1. The silixa DAS data used in this study is collected from the 2022 16A well hydraulic stimulation via https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1393

2. Silixa provided a DAS catalog can be accessed via https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1423

3. The deep borehole geophone catalog provided by the Geo-Energie Suiss is greatly appreciated especially (Ben Dyer, Dimitrios Karvounis, Falko Bethmann), which could be accessed via https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1558

4. Porras et al. (2024) provided a DAS catalog for Stage 3 hydraulic stimulation, which could be found in the data folder or from the paper of Porras, J., Pecci, D., Bocchini, G. M., Gaviano, S., De Solda, M., Tuinstra, K., ... & Grigoli, F. (2024). A semblance-based microseismic event detector for DAS data. Geophysical Journal International, 236(3), 1716-1727.
